# Programming Game AI By Example — Study Repository

This repository contains my personal C++ implementations from the book **"Programming Game AI By Example" by Mat Buckland**.

I'm using this space to practice, rewrite, and experiment with the examples from each chapter as I study the book.  
Everything here is for learning purposes only.

## Structure
- **State-Driven-Agent-Design** — early exercises and simple state machines  
- **WestWorld** — main project from the first chapters (entities, states, messaging)

## Goal
Improve my understanding of Game AI architecture by re-creating the book’s examples step by step.
